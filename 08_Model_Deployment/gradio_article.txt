### Food Classifier with Visual Transformer

This classifier is the milestone project for the course 'PyTorch for deep neural networks bootcamp' by mr. Daniel Bourke.
After having weighted the performance of two different models:
* EffNet_B2 (<a href='https://docs.pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.efficientnet_b2.html'>PyTorch doc link here</a>)
* ViT_b_16 (<a href='https://docs.pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.vit_b_16.html#torchvision.models.vit_b_16'>PyTorch doc link here</a>)

It has been decided to work with the ViT transformer as its size (300Mb of memory compared to the 28Mb of the EffNet_B2) are overpowering the accuracy of the other model, without brining in a huge amount of time to compute the prediction
Here under a brief description of the preiction-time vs. performance of the models.
